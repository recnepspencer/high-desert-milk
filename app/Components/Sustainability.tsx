Thus we can see that this steam does not represent environmental contamination, but the opposite - environmental stewardship. This steam is constantly measured to ensure it does not contain pollutants.",

Over 1,000 of our cows are milked by robots, creating efficiency, increasing cow happiness (yes, it’s true, by allowing them to be milked voluntarily, they are much more content), and cutting out many unnecessary steps in the process of bringing our products to your table.",
